Basic Linear Cost Function Modelling Home Prices

This directory shows how to compute a basic cost function to model home prices. 
I've included 2 versions of the code, one is a simple linear regression model,
the other is an interactive linearcostfunction code along with a pdf of outputs 
to help visualize the cost function parameters
